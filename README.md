# This is a README explained what the analysis file did

### The analysis file depends on following steps

* Read data form files to R
* Name train_set and test_set
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* Name the activity depends on activity_labels
* Name the inertial signals data
* Name other variables
* Generate the group variable
* Merge inertial signals data
* Merge data in train group and test group independently
* Merge data of train group and test group
* Generate a new function to calculate the mean of the col
* Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject 
* Save the tidy data
